3D Reconfigurable Cluster-based Network-on-Chip Simulator
-------------------------------------------

This project is a C++ code written by MS Visual Studio 2015 (Version 14.0.25123.00 Update2) (in win32 console application mode) which can simulate a 3-dimensional Cluster-based Reconfigurable Network-on-Chip.

This project is under construction, so additional details will be presented soon in this file. Best way for study simulation method is studying the code of simulator. The main file of simulator code is in below path:

RecNoC_simulator2/RecNoC_simulator2.cpp

For beginning, if you want to obtain more information about a Cluster-based Reconfigurable Network-on-Chip please study below paper:
