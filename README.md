3D Reconfigurable Cluster-based Network-on-Chip Simulator
-------------------------------------------

This project is a C++ code written by MS Visual Studio 2015 (Version 14.0.25123.00 Update2) (in win32 console application mode) which can simulate a 3-dimensional Cluster-based Reconfigurable Network-on-Chip.
This project is under construction, so additional details will be presented soon in this file.
